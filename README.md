# Sliced Art
A drawing puzzle

To try it out, download the source code, and install the dependencies using
`pipenv`. Find a picture that you like, and download it. Black and white works
best, avoid cross hatching, because it's hard to copy.

Run the program, and open the image file. Download the word file from
[vograbulary], and open that. Type a word for each letter on the words tab.
Go back to the art tab, and drag the squares around until you like the position.
Then, shuffle the squares until you like the arrangement. Save the puzzle as
a PDF, and then print out the PDF. Challenge your friends to solve the puzzle!

Each square gets a clue. Add one letter and unscramble the word. The added
letter tells you which position to draw the square in.

## Ideas
Right now, the word puzzle is too hard, particularly with words longer than six
letters. Maybe try something more like a standard anagram with one position
highlighted to show which position each square goes in.
